.SH NAME
UDP-based tranport for 0MQ
.SH SYNOPSIS

UDP transport is exactly the same as PGM transport except that PGM packets
are encapsulated in UDP packets. Rationale for this transport is that user-space
implementation of PGM requires right to create raw sockets (PGM is located
directly on top of IP layer in the netwroking stack), which is often not
available. UDP encapsulation solves this problem, however, it adds some overhead
related to creating and transferring UDP packet headers.

.SH CONNECTION STRING

Connection string for UDP transport is "udp://" followed by an IP adress
of the NIC to use, semicolon, IP adress of the multicast group, colon and
port numbrt. IP address of the NIC can be either its numeric representation
or the name of the NIC as reported by operating system. IP address of the
mutlicast group should be specified in the numeric representation. For example:

.nf
    udp://eth0:224.0.0.1:5555
    udp://lo:230.0.0.0:6666
    udp://192.168.0.111:224.0.0.1:5555
.fi

.SH WIRE FORMAT

Same as with PGM transport except for UDP packet headers.
