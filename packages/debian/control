Description: Library for ZeroMQ
 ZeroMQ is a very fast, thin messaging implementation which supports different
 messaging models. It reaches 13.4 microseconds end-to-end latencies and up to
 4,100,000 messages a second today. It requires only a couple of pages in
 resident memory. It supports different wire protocols: TCP, PGM, AMQP, and
 SCTP.
 .
 There are C, C++, Lisp, Java, Python, Ruby, and .NET language APis.
 .
 It is fully distributed: no central servers to crash, millions of WAN and
 LAN nodes. It is an extensible framework: kernel-style drivers for custom
 hardware, protocols, or applications.
 .
 This package contains ZeroMQ related development libraries and header files.
