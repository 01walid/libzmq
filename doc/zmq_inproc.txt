zmq_inproc(7)
=============


NAME
----
zmq_inproc - 0MQ transport to pass messages between threads


SYNOPSIS
--------
In-process transport is optimised for passing messages between threads in the
same process.

Messages are passed directly from one application thread to
another application thread. There are no intervening I/O threads involved.
Thus, if you are using 0MQ for in-process messaging only, you can initialise
the library (linkzmq:zmq_init[3]) with zero I/O worker threads.


CONNECTION STRING
-----------------
Connection string for inproc transport is "inproc://" followed by an arbitrary
string. There are no restrictions on the string format:

----
    inproc://my_endpoint
    inproc://feeds/opra/cboe
    inproc://feeds.opra.nasdaq
    inproc://!&W#($)_@_123*((^^^
----


WIRE FORMAT
-----------
In-process transport transfers messages via memory thus there is no need for a
wire format specification.
