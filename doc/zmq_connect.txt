zmq_connect(3)
==============


NAME
----
zmq_connect - connect the socket to the specified peer


SYNOPSIS
--------
'int zmq_connect (void *s, const char *addr);'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The function connect socket 's' to the peer identified by 'addr'.  Actual
semantics of the  command depend on the underlying transport mechanism,
however, in cases where peers connect in an asymmetric manner, 'zmq_bind'
should be called first, 'zmq_connect' afterwards. Formats of the 'addr'
parameter are defined by individual transports. For a list of supported
transports have a look at linkzmq:zmq[7] manual page.

Note that single socket can be connected (and bound) to
arbitrary number of peers using different transport mechanisms.


RETURN VALUE
------------
In case of success the function returns zero. Otherwise it returns -1 and
sets 'errno' to the appropriate value.


ERRORS
------
*EPROTONOSUPPORT*::
unsupported protocol.
*ENOCOMPATPROTO*::
protocol is not compatible with the socket type.


EXAMPLE
-------
----
void *s = zmq_socket (context, ZMQ_SUB);
assert (s);
int rc = zmq_connect (s, "inproc://my_publisher");
assert (rc == 0);
rc = zmq_connect (s, "tcp://server001:5555");
assert (rc == 0);
