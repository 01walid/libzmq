zmq_bind(3)
===========


NAME
----
zmq_bind - binds the socket to the specified address


SYNOPSIS
--------
'int zmq_bind (void *s, const char *addr);'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The function binds socket 's' to a particular transport. Actual semantics of the
command depend on the underlying transport mechanism, however, in cases where
peers connect in an asymmetric manner, 'zmq_bind' should be called first,
'zmq_connect' afterwards. Actual formats of 'addr' parameter are defined by
individual transports. For a list of supported transports have a look at
linkzmq:zmq[7] manual page.

Note that single socket can be bound (and connected) to
arbitrary number of peers using different transport mechanisms.


RETURN VALUE
------------
In case of success the function returns zero. Otherwise it returns -1 and
sets 'errno' to the appropriate value.


ERRORS
------
*EPROTONOSUPPORT*::
unsupported protocol.
*ENOCOMPATPROTO*::
protocol is not compatible with the socket type.
*EADDRINUSE*::
the given address is already in use.
*EADDRNOTAVAIL*::
a nonexistent interface was requested or the requested address was not local.


EXAMPLE
-------
----
void *s = zmq_socket (context, ZMQ_PUB);
assert (s);
int rc = zmq_bind (s, "inproc://my_publisher");
assert (rc == 0);
rc = zmq_bind (s, "tcp://eth0:5555");
assert (rc == 0);
