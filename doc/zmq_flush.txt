zmq_flush(3)
============


NAME
----
zmq_flush - flush messages queued on a socket


SYNOPSIS
--------
*int zmq_flush (void '*socket');*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The _zmq_flush()_ function shall flush messages previously queued on the socket
referenced by the 'socket' argument. The _zmq_flush()_ function only affects
messages that have been queued on the _message queue_ associated with 'socket'
using the 'ZMQ_NOFLUSH' flag to the _zmq_send()_ function. If no such messages
exist, the function has no effect.

CAUTION: A successful invocation of _zmq_flush()_ does not indicate that the
flushed messages have been transmitted to the network, or even that such a
transmission has been initiated by 0MQ. This function exists merely as a way
for the application programmer to supply a hint to the 0MQ infrastructure that
the queued messages *may* be flushed as a single batch.


RETURN VALUE
------------
The _zmq_flush()_ function shall return zero if successful. Otherwise it shall
return `-1` and set 'errno' to one of the values defined below.


ERRORS
------
*ENOTSUP*::
The _zmq_flush()_ operation is not supported by this socket type.
*EFSM*::
The _zmq_flush()_ operation cannot be performed on this socket at the moment
due to the socket not being in the appropriate state.
