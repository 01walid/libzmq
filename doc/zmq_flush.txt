zmq_flush(3)
============


NAME
----
zmq_flush - flushes pre-sent messages to the socket


SYNOPSIS
--------
'int zmq_flush (void *s);'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Flushes all the pre-sent messages - i.e. those that have been sent with
ZMQ_NOFLUSH flag - to the socket. This functionality improves performance in
cases where several messages are sent during a single business operation.
It should not be used as a transaction - ACID properties are not guaranteed.
Note that calling 'zmq_send' without ZMQ_NOFLUSH flag automatically flushes all
previously pre-sent messages.


RETURN VALUE
------------
In case of success the function returns zero. Otherwise it returns -1 and
sets 'errno' to the appropriate value.


ERRORS
------
*ENOTSUP*::
function isn't supported by particular socket type.
*EFSM*::
function cannot be called at the moment, because socket is not in the
approprite state.


EXAMPLE
-------
----
rc = zmq_send (s, &msg1, ZMQ_NOFLUSH);
assert (rc == 0);
rc = zmq_send (s, &msg2, ZMQ_NOFLUSH);
assert (rc == 0);
rc = zmq_flush (s);
assert (rc == 0);
