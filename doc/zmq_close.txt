zmq_close(3)
============


NAME
----
zmq_close - close 0MQ socket


SYNOPSIS
--------
*int zmq_close (void '*socket');*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The _zmq_close()_ function shall destroy the socket referenced by the 'socket'
argument. Any outstanding messages physically received from the network but not
yet received by the application with _zmq_recv()_ shall also be dropped. As for
the messages sent with _zmq_send()_ but not yet passed to the network, 0MQ
will try to send them in the background after _zmq_close()_ returns. Time spent
attempting can be set using _ZMQ_LINGER_ socket option.


RETURN VALUE
------------
The _zmq_close()_ function shall return zero if successful. Otherwise it shall
return `-1` and set 'errno' to one of the values defined below.


ERRORS
------
*EFAULT*::
The provided 'socket' was not valid (NULL).
