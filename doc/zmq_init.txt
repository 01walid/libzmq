zmq_init(3)
===========


NAME
----
zmq_init - initialise 0MQ context


SYNOPSIS
--------
*void *zmq_init (int 'app_threads', int 'io_threads', int 'flags');*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The _zmq_init()_ function initialises a 0MQ 'context' with 'app_threads'
application threads and 'io_threads' I/O threads.

The 'app_threads' argument specifies the maximum number of application threads
that will be using 0MQ sockets in this 'context'. As a guide, set this to the
number of threads in your application.

The 'io_threads' argument specifies the size of the 0MQ thread pool to handle
I/O operations. If your application is using 'inproc' messaging exclusively you
may set this to zero, otherwise set it to at least one.

There are no flags defined at the moment and the 'flags' argument should be set
to zero.


RETURN VALUE
------------
The _zmq_init()_ function shall return an opaque handle to the initialised
'context' if successful. Otherwise it shall return NULL and set 'errno' to one
of the values defined below.


ERRORS
------
*EINVAL*::
The number of 'app_threads' requested is less than one, or the number of
'io_threads' requested is negative.
